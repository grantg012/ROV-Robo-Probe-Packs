# Readme for ROV - Robo Probe Packs

This PCB serves as a integration layer for basic ROVs (though it could be
creatively used in other applications). It is designed for modularity and
fitting multiple different configurations. Perfect for high schoolers with
a little electronics experience, but not PCB design.

Features include:
* Pins for connecting to an Arduino Uno or Mega (use double sides ones for best effect)
* 12V+ input with reverse voltage protection
* Connections to common 12V -> 5V converters (such as ...)
* Up to 6 Electronic Speed Controllers (with options for protection circuitry)
* Breakouts for servos and I2C
* Primarily through hole components for easy soldering


## See `versions` for schematic PDFs and gerber files


## Parts List
* Arduino Uno or Mega
* Anderson power pole to PCB (1377G12 or similar)
